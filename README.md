# Capstone Project

## Project Overview

I will be building a rogue-like videogame that will have the following: A 2D view in which you can move your character along the screen with either your mouse OR pressed key commands, different currencies and experience points that will lead to more of a meta-progression experience, and lastly, enemies and obstacles will become progressively more challenging to overcome the longer you last throughout your run. The end goal is that I want the player to be able to run and move about the screen at their will (to some extent.) Whether that’s by pressing the arrow keys or moving the mouse doesn’t matter to me, though both will be an option. I want the player to be able to collide with certain items and collect them as currencies so they can purchase new things with them. Slay enemies so they can receive XP, level up, and choose permanent upgrades. Lastly, I want them to receive a certain amount of damage until their run ends, and they restart at the beginning.
