from django.contrib import admin

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('profileapp.urls')),
    #django authentication system. Has a package inside of it that will take care of all our urls for us
    #Simply put, beacuse of this, we do not need a login page, logout page, registration page, etc... it will handle those urls for us for the most part
    path('loginapp/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),
    #Why two urls that point to the same place? First: The order of operations is important, so we need this one listed first
    #because django will try to use these authentication urls that come with this package and if it see something else it needs to 
    #know where to go, and in that case we have it pointed at our loginapp.urls
    path('loginapp/', include('loginapp.urls')),
